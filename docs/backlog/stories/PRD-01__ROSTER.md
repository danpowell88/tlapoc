## Background

Foundations & tenancy (auth, RBAC, audit, data model) — The domain backbone on top of the Sprint 0 plumbing: tenant provisioning, RBAC + scope-of-practice enforcement, the credential/PII compliance gate that decides who can inject, the exportable audit trail, retention & destruction, the data-breach workflow, and client privacy rights.

As a manager, I want to record staff rosters/time-off and each person's engagement type, so that booking availability reflects who is actually working and cleared.

A roster (plus employee/contractor engagement type) drives booking availability and feeds commission/pay attribution downstream.

## Requirements

- To record staff rosters/time-off and each person's engagement type.
- Traces to requirement(s): REQ-TEN-8, REQ-TEN-9.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Rosters and time-off are recorded per staff member and location.
- [ ] Booking availability is derived from roster ∩ canInject (consumed by PRD-02).
- [ ] Engagement type (employee/contractor) is recorded per staff member.
- [ ] Roster changes are audited.
