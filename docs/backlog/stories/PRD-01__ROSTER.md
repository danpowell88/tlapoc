## Background

As a manager, I want to record staff rosters/time-off and each person's engagement type, so that booking availability reflects who is actually working and cleared.
A roster (plus employee/contractor engagement type) drives booking availability and feeds commission/pay attribution downstream.

## Requirements

- To record staff rosters/time-off and each person's engagement type.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Rosters and time-off are recorded per staff member and location.
- [ ] Booking availability is derived from roster ∩ canInject (consumed by PRD-02).
- [ ] Engagement type (employee/contractor) is recorded per staff member.
- [ ] Roster changes are audited.

## Tasks (dev pickup)

- [ ] **Domain logic & business rules** — Core behaviour + invariants.
- [ ] **API endpoint(s) + OpenAPI contract** — Wire request/response; regenerate clients.
- [ ] **Tests (unit + integration)** — Cover acceptance criteria, incl. any gate/invariant.
