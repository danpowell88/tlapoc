## Background

As a client, I want to give separate consent for photo use and withdraw it whenever I want, so that I control how my images are used.
Photo use requires its own scoped consent, withdrawable at any time, which immediately stops downstream use (C14).

## Requirements

- To give separate consent for photo use and withdraw it whenever I want.
- Compliance: [C14](https://github.com/danpowell88/tlapoc/blob/main/docs/02-requirements.md#6-compliance-requirements-auqld--restated-as-acceptance-criteria)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Image-use consent is separate from treatment consent and scoped.
- [ ] Withdrawing it immediately stops further use and is audited.
- [ ] Downstream media features (PRD-05/09) check this consent.
- [ ] Granted/withdrawn state is visible on the patient header chip.

## Technical notes (high level)

- Stack: .NET API (domain/services)

## Tasks (dev pickup)

- [ ] **Domain logic & business rules** — Core behaviour + invariants.
- [ ] **API endpoint(s) + OpenAPI contract** — Wire request/response; regenerate clients.
- [ ] **Enforce compliance gate + audit events** — Server-side (C14); blocked path explains why.
- [ ] **Tests (unit + integration)** — Cover acceptance criteria, incl. any gate/invariant.
