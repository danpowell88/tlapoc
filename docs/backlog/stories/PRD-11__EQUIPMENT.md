## Background

As a owner, I want to track equipment servicing, validation and calibration with reminders, so that devices stay safe, validated and within service.
The prototype's Operations → Equipment & maintenance tracks sterilisation/equipment servicing (autoclave validation, spore testing, laser service/calibration) with due dates — promoted from the FAC-WORKFLOWS placeholder.

## Requirements

- To track equipment servicing, validation and calibration with reminders.
- Compliance: [C20](https://github.com/danpowell88/tlapoc/blob/main/docs/02-requirements.md#6-compliance-requirements-auqld--restated-as-acceptance-criteria)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Equipment records hold service/validation/calibration schedules (e.g. autoclave validation, spore testing, laser service).
- [ ] Due/overdue items raise alerts and surface on the operations view.
- [ ] Service events are logged with evidence and audited.
- [ ] Feeds the inspection-readiness pack (PRD-08).

## Technical notes (high level)

- Stack: Angular web (admin/front-desk/public)
- Architecture decisions: [ADR-0026](https://github.com/danpowell88/tlapoc/blob/main/docs/adr/decision-log.md)

## Tasks (dev pickup)

- [ ] **Enforce compliance gate + audit events** — Server-side (C20); blocked path explains why.
- [ ] **Web UI** — prototype.html — Front desk/Operations (Open/close & fridge log, Temperature monitors, Rooms & devices, Equipment, Call log); backroom.html.
- [ ] **Tests (unit + integration)** — Cover acceptance criteria, incl. any gate/invariant.
